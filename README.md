# Advent of Code 2022

Trying something new for Advent of Code this year. Doing it in Python, of course, but also trying to see if I can
get all my solutions to run on a CircuitPython board as well! Might try MicroPython too if I have the time.

My approach is going to be first simply prototype in straight CPython on the PC, to get my head around the algorithm
for the day. Then I'll see what I have to do to get it to run in the more constrained environment.
